Intended Users: higher education students in STEM program classes, educators, engineers, physicists, and many chemists. 
What does the program do? Display text prompting user input, check for input validity. If inputs are valid, solution will be displayed. If inputs are not valid for function, an error message will be displayed and the user will be taken back to the index page. From index page, user will be prompted to re-enter the input correctly.
